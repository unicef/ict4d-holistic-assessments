# Checklist for Success\*

* [ ] **Comprehensive, Robust, Accessibly Written Documentation**
  * How to Install Guides & User Guides make the reader prepared and the process more attainable
  * Videos are also helpful for installation and adoption
* [ ] **Interoperable Solutions**
  * Usually other pieces of technology already exist. Thus, there is a need to connect and work seamlessly with these pieces. When undergoing digital transformation initiatives it is imperative a solution is interoperable with other e-government solutions.&#x20;
* [ ] **Lived Experiences**&#x20;
  * Considering the context of those implementing the solution is necessary. Lived experiences referring to including real-world workflows into your decision.&#x20;
    * &#x20;Ex: Do you need to include digital literacy training to your onboarding for field workers? Do you expect field agents to use their personal phones to run the solution, or is hardware provided and how do you train offices on management of these hardware units? Is there 24hr connectivity for electricity and internet?&#x20;
* [ ] **Knowledge Redundancy**&#x20;
  * Having a community of contributors, decentralized learning, distributive expertise..something about what Darren says...
* [ ] **Iterative Audits**
  * Audits are like a litmus test. Quickly highlighting vulnerabilities and the health of the solution as a whole. Technology is rapidly progressing and therefore, it's necessary to regularly test the health of a system and look for exposed vulnerabilities.&#x20;
  * _Tip: Use a third-party auditor for unbiased results._&#x20;
* [ ] **Holistic Security**&#x20;
  * This means thinking about both how you design a solution to reduce harm, vulnerabilities regarding the code itself and the human factor--how humans can use the solution for harm, hack it for sensitive information or engineer it to cause mass destruction.&#x20;
* [ ] **Engaged Team**
  * We understand time and financial restrictions are often at play here, but working alongside a team that is responsive, communicates effectively, and engages in the process of fixing vulnerabilities or bugs, can help ensure success.
* [ ] **Open Source Technology**
  * We firmly stand behind open source technology. It is transparent, collaborative, replicable and the community can contribute, making it a better solution for all.&#x20;
    *   _Tip: Many DPGs are Open Source technologies by nature._&#x20;
